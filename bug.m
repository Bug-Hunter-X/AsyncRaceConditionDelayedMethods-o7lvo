In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@property (strong, nonatomic) MyObject *myObject;

- (void)someMethod {
    self.myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    // ... some code ...
    [self performSelector:@selector(anotherMethod) withObject:nil afterDelay:1.0];
}

- (void)anotherMethod {
    // ... use self.myObject ...
}
```

The problem:  `self.myObject` might be deallocated before `anotherMethod` is called. If `someMethod` ends before the delay elapses and no other strong reference to `myObject` remains, ARC will release it.

This leads to a crash or unexpected behavior in `anotherMethod` because `self.myObject` will be `nil`. This is a classic example of a race condition related to object lifetime.
